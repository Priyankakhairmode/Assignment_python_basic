        "The five main concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Classes/Objects. These concepts work together to help organize code by creating modular, reusable, and maintainable programs.\n",
        "Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.\n",
        "Encapsulation: Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit called a class, and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.\n",
        "Inheritance: A mechanism where a new class (subclass) derives properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass), promoting code reusability.\n",
        "Polymorphism: The ability of an object to take on many forms. In practice, it means that a method can be called on an object, and the specific method that runs depends on the object's type.\n",
        "Classes and Objects: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, while an object is a specific instance of a class"

        "In Python, the Method Resolution Order (MRO) dictates the sequence in which Python searches for methods and attributes within a class hierarchy, particularly in scenarios involving multiple inheritance. This order ensures a consistent and predictable lookup mechanism, resolving potential ambiguities that arise when methods with the same name exist in different parent classes. Python utilizes the C3 linearization algorithm to determine the MRO, which ensures properties like monotonicity and local precedence order.\n",

        "Using the __mro__ attribute: This attribute, available on any class, returns a tuple representing the MRO.\n",
