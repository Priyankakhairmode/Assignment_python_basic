        "1. Simple and easy to learn:  python has a clear and easy to read syntax, its code closely resembles english, reducing the learning curve.\n",
        "2. Interpreted language: python execute code line by line which make debugging easier\n",
        "3. versatile and general purpose: python is used for wide range of applicationsincluding web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence.\n",
        "4. extensive standard library: python comes with vast standard libraries that provides modules and functions for task like web development.\n",
        "5. Large community and support: python has massive global community.\n",
